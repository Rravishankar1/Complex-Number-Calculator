# Complex Number Calculator

The Complex Number Calculator offers methods for handling and computation using complex numbers.

## Description

The Complex Number Calculator offers a .class and .java file with static and nonstatic methods to handle complex numbers and operate on said numbers. All methods are derived from java.lang.Math and can be treated as an extension of the math module. The software extends basic math operations for use with complex numbers, allowing for functions like addition and subtraction to work with such numbers. Additionally, methods for powers of complex numbers and complex powers of complex numbers have been added. The calculator further allows for operation of trigonemtric functions and has methods to determine the roots of a quadratic series. The math utilized to develop formulas can be found from the .java file. Further documentation on parameters and means of operation can be found here aswell.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Java 13 or higher

### Installing

* Download the .class file
* Download the .java file

### Executing program

* Refer to documentation in .java file
* Create new .java file
* Utilize static or nonstatic methods to run functions from the Complex class
* Ensure both files stored in same folder
* Execute code-- results returned in form "a + bi"

## Future Objectives

* Front end interface to run as fully functioning calculator
* Web upload to prevent need for downloaing files
